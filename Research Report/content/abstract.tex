We performed a rigorous analysis of machine learning regression models for the general problem of predicting the equity risk premium of various asset prices without accounting for transaction cost and optimal drawdown strategies. Machine learning strategies have become more prevalent in asset pricing research; however, these strategies tend to create unnecessary bias and over-fitting. In addition to predicting equity risk premiums, we identify group-specific models that can reduce overfitting and improve performance.
